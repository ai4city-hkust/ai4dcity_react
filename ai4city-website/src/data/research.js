    title: "NeighborMAE: Exploiting Spatial Dependencies between Neighboring Earth Observation Images in Masked Autoencoders Pretraining",
    desc: "We propose NeighborMAE, which learns spatial dependencies by joint reconstruction of neighboring Earth Observation images. To ensure that the reconstruction remains challenging, we leverage a heuristic strategy to dynamically adjust the mask ratio and the pixel-level loss weight. Experimental results across various pretraining datasets and downstream tasks show that NeighborMAE significantly outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the value of neighboring images in Masked Image Modeling for Earth Observation and the efficacy of our designs.",

    desc: "We are the first to tame Artist-Mesh (AM) generation models for severely disturbed input point clouds commonly encountered in large-scale urban observations, by introducing 3D generative priors. We design a Loosely Cascaded Diffusion Transformer (Loca-DiT) that initially recovers the underlying distribution from noisy or sparse points, followed by autoregressively encapsulating them into compact meshes.",

Experiments across five U.S. cities yield an F1 score of 79.77%, significantly outperforming non-fine-tuned models, providing a scalable tool for urban planning.",

    desc: "Building upon MVG-Splatting, ULSR-GS proposes a 'point-to-photo partitioning + multi-view guided densification + cross-view depth/normal consistency constraint' framework. It supports cross-GPU parallel training and enables independent mesh extraction with seamless stitching across sub-regions. On multiple urban-scale aerial survey datasets, it consistently outperforms existing GS methods and traditional MVS-based pipelines, opening new pathways for remote sensing mapping and digital twins.",
