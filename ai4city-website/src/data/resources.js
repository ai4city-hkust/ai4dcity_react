    title: "BuildingView-Turbo",
    desc: "Buildings provide unique insights into the urban environment, encompassing physical, functional, and aesthetic dimensions. Traditional approaches often rely on remote sensing (sky-view) or street-level imagery (street-view) for building information extraction but tend to focus on isolated perspectives. These methods limit the holistic understanding of urban morphology and functionality.\nBuildingView-Turbo addresses this gap by integrating sky-view and street-view imagery using advanced computational techniques. This novel framework enables the construction of a comprehensive, multi-city building database for deeper urban analysis.",

It then calculates key tree metrics—such as Tree Height, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), Crown Radius (CR), Crown Depth (CD), and Volume/Surface Area—from the skeleton or filtered leaf nodes. Simultaneously, it outputs a single JSON report and a batch CSV summary file.",
